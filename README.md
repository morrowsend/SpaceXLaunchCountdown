# SpaceXLaunchCoutdown
Using rocketlaunch.live free API, print a countdown until the next SpaceX launch.

I have 2 versions. The first just does the countdown in the terminal. It checks daily at 1am to get the latest launch data. After a launch, it waits 1 hour, then checks for the next launch.

The second version is designed to work with an I2C LCD screen, though I don't have the hardware myself to test it.
